 * This class offers the ability to do jobs in realtime as it allows to block other jobs untill
 * defined jobs are done etc.
 * It is highly recommended to use a cron job or use a progamm on the server to do the jobs as it would take
 * a lot too long if there are a lot of active users

 * @todo: Almost everything :) So move on... nothing to see here...
